suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet is incomplete. It does not define any routes or implement the logic for handling requests.
- The code needs to include the implementation for the router module to handle the requests correctly.
- The code does not provide the router modules so that the main app can perform the task requested.

- This snippet only contains the router code, it does not provide the app.js code that sets up the express application

suggestions for improvement:
- The `app.use('/', router)` line should be `app.use('/todos', router)` in Exercise 2 to correctly mount the router at the `/todos` path as intended by the instructions. Otherwise, the routes defined in the `todos.js` will be accessible from `/` which is not the intention.
- In Exercise 3, the `app.use('/', router)` line should be `app.use('/books', router)` to correctly mount the router at the `/books` path.
- The code snippets for `app.js` are incomplete, lacking the import statement for express and other configurations needed to complete exercises 2 and 3. This may impact correctness if the user solely relies on the provided snippets.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more robust method for generating unique IDs instead of `todos.length + 1`, especially in a production environment. A UUID library is often preferred.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or injection attacks.
- Add error handling to catch unexpected exceptions during API operations.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, you have to create the routes `index.js` and mount them on `app.js` file.
- In Exercise 2 and Exercise 3, you need to implement all the CRUD methods to the `todos.js` file and `books.js` file respectively.
- Include error handling for scenarios like invalid IDs or missing data.
- Consider using more robust data storage than in-memory arrays, especially for production environments.

suggestions for improvement:
- In the DELETE route, `splice` returns an array of deleted items. While you access the first element `libroDelete[0]`, consider directly assigning the spliced element for clarity: `const [libroDelete] = books.splice(libroDeleteIndex, 1);`.
- For the PUT and DELETE requests, it's better to send a 204 No Content status upon successful update/deletion without returning the object.
- Consider adding validation to the POST and PUT requests to ensure that the required fields (title, author) are present and of the correct type.
- While using an in-memory database is suitable for this exercise, be aware that data will be lost when the server restarts.  A real-world application would require a persistent database.
