suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is the entry point for a React application and does not implement any of the form handling logic described in the instructions.  It initializes the React application but doesn't create the `FormComponent` or `handleChange` function, nor does it handle form submission and URL parameter generation.
- The code should include the App.js file, and the FormComponent.js file.  App.js should be a stateful component with a handleChange function to manage form input, and FormComponent.js should render the form elements.
- A submit handler needs to be implemented to construct the URL with form data upon submission.
