suggestions for improvement:
- The switch case for 'admin' should match the case in the instructions ('admin' instead of 'Admin').
- The switch case for 'guest' should return the specified message ('Limited access' instead of 'limited access').
- Add a default case to the switch statement to handle cases where the role doesn't match any of the specified roles. This improves robustness and adheres to best practices for switch statements.

suggestions for improvement:
- The function name in the instructions is `getAction`, while the parameter name is `accion` which is a typo. Ensure consistency in naming.
- The case 'Admin' is incorrect. It should be 'admin' to match the test cases provided in the instructions.
- It would be better to declare and export all functions inside a module, in order to mantain a clean and structured code.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 3, the explanation in the comments is good, but a string value should also be assigned to demonstrate the union type fully.
- In Exercise 4, the function name should be descriptive of the intended functionality (e.g., 'checkNumberSign' instead of 'suma').
- In Exercise 5, the function `mostrarTupla` should return a tuple, not a string. The string interpolation is unnecessary and defeats the purpose of the exercise.
- Exercise 6 doesn't define the object structure/type annotation separately before using it in the `createPerson` function, which is a core requirement of the exercise. The property names in the object are also different than what was received as parameters (`fname` instead of `name`, `agePerson` instead of `age`).
- Exercises 1, 2, 7, 8 and 9 are missing.

suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 1 and 2 are missing.
- Exercise 3 is correct.
- Exercise 4 is correct.
- Exercise 5 is mostly correct, but the string interpolation is incorrect and doesn't fully match the requirements of the exercise. The function should return a tuple, not a string.
- Exercise 6 is correct.
- Exercise 7 is missing entirely.
- Exercise 8 and 9 are missing entirely.

suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML provides the structure for interacting with the DOM, but the TypeScript logic (meant to reside in `Exercise7xP.js`) is missing from this submission. The provided HTML by itself doesn't address the core task of Exercise 7 (Type Assertions) which requires using `document.getElementById()` and type assertions in TypeScript to manipulate DOM elements.
- To complete exercise 7 you will need to get an element from the DOM, use type assertion to cast the element to a specific HTML element type, access the element's properties, and test the functionality

suggestions for improvement:
- The code implements a function with an optional parameter, but it doesn't fully utilize function overloading as described in the exercise. Function overloading involves declaring multiple function signatures with different parameter types or counts. This code only has one signature with an optional parameter.
- To fully address the exercise requirements for function overloading, you should explicitly define two function signatures for `greet`: one with a `name` parameter and one without any parameters.
