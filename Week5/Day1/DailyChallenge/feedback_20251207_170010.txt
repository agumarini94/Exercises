suggestions for improvement:
- The function should iterate through all allowed types before returning false. Currently, it returns false immediately if the first type check fails.
- Consider adding more comprehensive tests with different data types to ensure robustness.

suggestions for improvement:
- The function returns prematurely. It should only return `false` after checking all `allowedTypes`.
- Consider returning `false` after the loop, indicating that the value's type did not match any of the allowed types.
- While not explicitly requested, adding type annotations for the `allowedTypes` variable would improve clarity.
- Avoid shadowing variables (e.g., naming the argument and the global variable `allowedTypes` the same). This can be confusing.
- The current implementation returns false if the type is not matched in the first item of the allowedTypes, it won't validate if other types match
