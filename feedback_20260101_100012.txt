suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the requirement to ensure that the same quote is not displayed twice in a row. This could be done by storing the last displayed quote and checking against it before setting a new quote.
- Consider using CSS classes instead of inline styles for better maintainability and separation of concerns.
- The code correctly uses React state, components, and event handlers as outlined in the problem description.
