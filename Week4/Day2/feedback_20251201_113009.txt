suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML form for exercises 1 and 2 is incomplete. Include the actual form elements (input and textarea) within the <form> tags. The button should be a submit button (type="submit").
- The form's 'action' attribute should point to a server-side script to handle the form submission, not the same HTML file unless you have server-side code to process the form data within the HTML file.  For a basic example, it's acceptable to point to the same file, but for a real application, you would use a different URL.
- Exercise 3's JavaScript part is good, but should be separated to another file to have good practices.
