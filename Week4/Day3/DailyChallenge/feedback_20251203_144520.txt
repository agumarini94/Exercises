suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using more descriptive variable names for better readability.
- The use of `setTimeout` is not required in the problem description and can be removed to simplify the code and make it execute synchronously.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using `const` instead of `let` for variables that are not reassigned, such as `codigoMorse` in the `toMorse` function, to improve code clarity and prevent accidental reassignment.
- Error handling could be improved by displaying the specific error message from the `reject` function in the `.catch` block, rather than a generic 'something is wrong' message.
