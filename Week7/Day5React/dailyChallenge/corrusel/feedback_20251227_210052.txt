URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week7/Day5React/dailyChallenge/corrusel/src/App.css
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided CSS code does not address the requirements of building a React Carousel using the react-responsive-carousel package. It is related to general app styling and does not include any carousel implementation.
- The code needs to implement the React component, install and import the carousel package, fetch or define image URLs, and use the carousel component to display those images.

suggestions for improvement:
- The App component should render the React Responsive Carousel with the images provided in the instructions.
- The MyCarousel component (not provided) needs to implement the carousel using the `react-responsive-carousel` package and display the images of Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, and Las Vegas.
- The current code only imports and renders a component named MyCarousel, but it doesn't use the react-responsive-carousel package or the provided images directly in the App component. This does not address the problem.

suggestions for improvement:

- The test checks for the presence of 'learn react' text, which is the default in a new React app, and not specific to the carousel implementation.
