suggestions for improvement:
- The task ID generation could be improved to avoid potential conflicts, especially in a concurrent environment. Consider using a UUID library.
- Error handling could be more robust. For example, you might want to log errors for debugging purposes.
- Consider using asynchronous file system operations (`fs.promises`) for improved performance and cleaner code with `async/await`.
- Implement input validation using a library like `express-validator` to ensure data integrity and prevent potential security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
- The code directly implements the core functionality requested: creating a Task Management API with CRUD operations on a JSON file. It retrieves tasks, gets a task by ID, creates, updates and deletes tasks.  It also includes basic validation for the POST request.
