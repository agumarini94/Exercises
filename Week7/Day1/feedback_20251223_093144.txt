URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week7/Day1/ExerciseXp1/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code lacks the implementation details for the routes. It only sets up the Express app and mounts a router from `./routes/`, but the actual route definitions are missing.
- The code should include the necessary middleware for parsing JSON request bodies, especially for Exercise 2 and 3 where POST and PUT requests with JSON payloads are expected.
- Consider adding error handling middleware to catch and handle errors gracefully.

- This submission is a `package.json` file, which is a configuration file for a Node.js project. While a `package.json` file is necessary for the Express.js exercises described in the chapter content, the file itself does not implement any of the required functionality, such as creating routes or handling HTTP requests. Therefore, it is not relevant to assessing the student's understanding of Express.js and `express.Router` as outlined in the exercises.
- The submission should include the `app.js` file which sets up the express application, and the route files (`index.js`, `todos.js`, `books.js`) which implement the routes.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more robust method for generating unique IDs, such as a UUID library, instead of relying on the array length.
- Implement input validation to ensure that the data received from the client is in the expected format. This can help prevent errors and improve security.
- Error handling could be improved. For example, consider adding try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions.
- The in-memory database is not persistent. Consider using a database for persistent data storage.
- Add comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section of code.
