suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using more descriptive variable names for improved readability.
- Implement proper error handling for different scenarios, such as when a resource is not found.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a package.json file, which only describes the project's metadata and dependencies. It doesn't implement any of the API functionality described in the exercises.
- To fulfill Exercise 1, a server.js file with Express routes and data handling logic is required.
- Exercises 2 and 3 need similar app.js implementations with appropriate routes and data handling, possibly incorporating data modules and Axios for external API calls.
