suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding PropTypes to the UserFavoriteAnimals component to explicitly define the expected type of the `favAnimals` prop. This can improve code maintainability and prevent unexpected errors.
- While the component is functionally correct, adding a conditional check to ensure that `favAnimals` is an array before mapping over it could make the component more robust.
