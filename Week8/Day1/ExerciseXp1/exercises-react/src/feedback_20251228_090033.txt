suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is CSS styling for the App component, but the exercises require the creation of React components and implementation of functionalities using JSX, state hooks, event handlers, and useEffect hook.
- The submission should include the code for App.js, Car.js, Garage.js, Events.js, and Color.js components to address the exercise instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided App.js only imports and renders components. To properly evaluate, I need to see the code for the components themselves (Car.js, Events.js, Phone.js, Garage.js) and how they implement the instructions for each exercise using functional components and hooks.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code implements the Events exercise using functional components and hooks as requested, but it is named `MyButton` instead of `Events` as specified in the instructions.
- It's better to keep components in separate files to improve code organization and readability. You can improve the project structure.
- The `HandleKeyDown` function name doesn't follow the camelCase convention for function names in JavaScript (should be handleKeyDown).
- Consider using more descriptive variable names to enhance readability.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is the entry point for the React application and doesn't address any of the specific exercises outlined in the chapter content. The exercises involve creating components, using state, handling events, and using the useEffect hook. This code simply renders the App component.
