suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the form submission logic to pass the entered data in the URL as query parameters. The current code captures the form data in the state, but does not submit it to the URL.
- Add a FormComponent to encapsulate the form rendering logic. This will improve the structure of the App component, making it more readable and maintainable.
- Handle the 'lactoseFree' checkbox correctly to align with the expected output in the URL. Currently, the checkbox is named 'dietary', but the URL expects 'lactoseFree'.
