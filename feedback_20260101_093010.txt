suggestions for improvement:
- The App component should fetch and manage the quotes data from the provided file.
- Implement the state to hold the current quote and author.
- Implement the function to generate a new quote, ensuring it's not the same as the previous one.
- Implement the function to change the background, header, and button colors randomly.
- Pass the quote, author, and button click handler to the DisplayImage component.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the 'do not display the same quote twice' requirement. Currently, the code might show the same quote consecutively.
- Improve the color change implementation to ensure sufficient contrast between the text and background. Sometimes the randomly generated colors might make the text unreadable.
- Consider using `useCallback` for the `ChangeQuote`, `randomColor`, `changeColor`, and `changeQuoteColor` functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially if they are passed as props to child components (though not applicable in this specific case, it's a good general practice).
- Consider extracting the styling into a separate CSS file or using a styling library like styled-components for better organization and maintainability.
