suggestions for improvement:
- The code lacks the core functionality of the task management API, particularly the routes to interact with the JSON file (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- It's missing the implementation of file read/write operations and data validation.
- Consider separating concerns further by moving the `app.listen` to a separate file or function.

suggestions for improvement:
- The task IDs are being generated sequentially, which can lead to issues if tasks are deleted and new ones are added. Consider using a UUID library to generate unique IDs.
- There's no input sanitization to prevent malicious data from being stored in the JSON file.
- The code reads and writes the entire JSON file for each operation. For larger datasets, consider using a database instead or implementing partial updates.
- Error messages could be more descriptive.
- Consider creating a separate module or utility function to handle file read/write operations to avoid code duplication.
