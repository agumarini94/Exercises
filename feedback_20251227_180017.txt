suggestions for improvement:
- The code only implements part of Exercise 3, specifically fetching data from an external API. It doesn't address the CRUD operations as a complete API as described in the instruction for exercise 3.
- The code mixes concerns by directly calling `fetchPosts` within the route handler. It would be better to separate the data fetching logic from the route handling logic.
- The error handling could be improved by providing more specific error messages and logging the errors for debugging purposes.
- The use of `async/await` is good for handling asynchronous operations, but it's important to handle potential errors using `try/catch` blocks.

URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day5NodeServer/ExerciseXP/Exercise2Xp/book-api/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The routes should be '/api/books' as specified in the instructions, not '/books'.
- The POST route should take the book details from the request body, not hardcode them.
- Error handling could be improved with more specific error messages and status codes.
- Consider using a more robust method for generating unique IDs, especially for larger datasets.  Incrementing `books.length` is simple but can lead to issues if books are deleted.

URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day5NodeServer/ExerciseXP/ExerciseXp1/blog-api/server.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The POST route hardcodes the new blog post's title and content. It should read these values from the request body.
- The PUT route also hardcodes the updated title and content.  It should read these values from the request body.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `blogPost` instead of `blog`).
- Add error handling to handle cases where the request body is missing or invalid.
