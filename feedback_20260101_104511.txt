suggestions for improvement:
- The code fulfills the basic requirement of adding two numbers. However, it goes beyond the initial requirements by implementing subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and average calculations.
- The code uses inline styles extensively, which can reduce readability and maintainability. Consider using CSS classes or a styling library.
- The initial state values for `valor1` and `valor2` are strings. It would be more appropriate to initialize them as empty strings or null to avoid potential type coercion issues later.
