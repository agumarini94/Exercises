URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day5NodeServer/ExerciseXP/Exercise2Xp/book-api/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The routes should be defined at `/api/books` instead of `/books` as specified in the prompt.
- The POST route for creating a book should use the data sent in the request body to create the book, instead of hardcoding the book's information.
- Consider adding error handling and validation to the POST route to ensure the data sent in the request body is valid.
- It's recommended to use a more robust method for generating unique IDs (e.g., UUIDs) instead of simply incrementing the length of the array. This avoids potential issues if books are deleted.
- The comments are in Spanish, making it harder for non-Spanish speakers to understand the code. Consider using English for comments to improve collaboration.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code appears to be a utility library, possibly extracted from a larger project like `axios`. It provides various helper functions for type checking, object manipulation, and other general-purpose tasks.
- However, it does not implement any of the API-building exercises described in the chapter content. There is no Express server setup, no route handling, and no CRUD operations.
- The code is completely unrelated to building RESTful APIs or CRUD APIs with Express.js.
- Due to the complete mismatch between the code's purpose and the exercise requirements, the correctness score is 0%.

- This submission appears to be a `tsconfig.json` file, which is used for configuring the TypeScript compiler. While `tsconfig.json` files are commonly used in Node.js projects (especially when using TypeScript), the exercises provided in the prompt are focused on building RESTful APIs with Express.js. Therefore, this file does not directly address any of the specific tasks outlined in the exercises.
- Since the exercises ask to build RESTful APIs with Express.js using JavaScript, a `tsconfig.json` file is irrelevant. The instructions specify the use of `npm init`, `npm install express`, creation of `.js` files, and implementation of routes. A `tsconfig.json` file is only relevant if the intention was to use TypeScript, which wasn't requested.
- If TypeScript was intended, then a TypeScript implementation of the API exercises is needed, not just the config file.

- This code appears to be related to testing and inspecting JavaScript values, using modules like `tape`, `mock-property`, `has-symbols`, `has-tostringtag`, `for-each`, and `semver`. It's designed to deeply inspect objects and values, and has nothing to do with building APIs using Node.js, Express, and Axios. The chapter exercises involve creating RESTful APIs.
- The code includes tests for various JavaScript types and edge cases, which is irrelevant in the context of the specified chapter content.

URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day5NodeServer/ExerciseXP/ExerciseXp1/blog-api/node_modules/side-channel-weakmap/package.json
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code is a `package.json` file, which describes a javascript package. It does not implement any of the API building exercises described in the chapter content. The file provides metadata about a library, including dependencies, scripts, and other configurations, but it does not define any Express routes or API logic.
- To address this, provide code that follows the instructions of exercises 1, 2 and 3, that implement a RESTful API using Express.js for blog posts (exercise 1) and books (exercises 2 & 3).

URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day5NodeServer/ExerciseXP/ExerciseXp1/blog-api/node_modules/side-channel-weakmap/test/index.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code is a test suite for a library called `getSideChannelWeakMap`. This library seems to deal with WeakMaps and side channels, which are data structures and concepts not covered or even mentioned in the chapter content about building RESTful APIs with Express.js. The exercises focus on creating basic CRUD APIs, so this test suite is entirely irrelevant.
- The code does not address any of the instructions provided in the chapter. It's not an Express.js API, doesn't involve creating routes, handling requests, or performing CRUD operations on data.
- Since this submission is not relevant to the exercises, it receives a 0% score for correctness.

- In the POST request, instead of hardcoding the new blog post's title and content, you should use the data provided in the request body.
- In the PUT request, similar to the POST request, use data from the request body to update the blog post instead of hardcoding the values.
- The PUT request should send a more appropriate status code, such as 200 OK, upon successful update.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names to improve readability.
- Add error handling for the case where the request body is missing or invalid in the POST and PUT routes.
