URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day5NodeServer/ExerciseXP/Exercise2Xp/book-api/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The routes should be prefixed with `/api` as specified in the instructions, e.g., `/api/books` instead of `/books`.
- The POST route should use data provided in the request body to create the new book, not hardcoded values. The current implementation always creates a book with the same title, author and published year.
- Error handling could be improved, for example, by checking if the request body contains the required fields for creating a book in the POST request.
- The `books.find` method in GET `/books/:id` could be simplified by using destructuring in the callback function: `books.find(({id}) => id === parseInt(req.params.id))`.

suggestions for improvement:
- This submission consists of a `package-lock.json` file, which specifies the versions of dependencies for a Node.js project. While this file is important for managing project dependencies, it doesn't implement any of the API functionalities described in the exercises.
- The exercises require the creation of API endpoints using Express.js to perform CRUD operations on data. Therefore, a code submission should include the `server.js` or `app.js` file that defines the routes and logic for handling HTTP requests.

suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code is a `package.json` file, which defines the project's metadata and dependencies but doesn't implement any of the requested API functionality. The exercises required building RESTful APIs using Express.js, handling routes, and potentially interacting with external APIs using Axios. This file only sets up the project environment but doesn't contain any of the logic for those tasks.
- To fulfill the exercise requirements, you need to create `server.js` or `app.js` files containing the Express routes and logic for handling requests and responses. Ensure the creation of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints for managing blog posts or books.
- In Exercise 3, implement the data module `dataService.js` to fetch posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.

However, it doesn't implement any of the API building tasks outlined in the exercises (building a RESTful API, a CRUD API, or an API using Axios to fetch data).
- The code is completely unrelated to building RESTful APIs with Express as described in the chapter content.
- Since the code doesn't attempt to solve the problems posed in the exercises, it's not possible to evaluate its correctness in that context.

- In the POST route, you're hardcoding the new blog post's title and content.  You should instead use the data from the request body (req.body).
- The PUT route also hardcodes the updated title and content.  It should also use req.body to update the blog post's data dynamically.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., 'blogPost' instead of 'blog').
- Implement more robust error handling, especially for invalid input data in POST and PUT requests.
- Implement validation to ensure that the data being created or updated is in the correct format and contains all required fields.
