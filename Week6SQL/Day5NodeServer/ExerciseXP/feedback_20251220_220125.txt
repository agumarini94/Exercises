URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day5NodeServer/ExerciseXP/Exercise2Xp/book-api/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The API routes should ideally be prefixed with `/api` as suggested in the exercises (e.g., `/api/books`).
- In the POST route, instead of hardcoding the book details, the book data should come from the request body. Access the `req.body` object to get the details of the new book.
- Error handling could be improved. For instance, you could check if the title or author is missing in the POST request and return a 400 error (Bad Request).
- While the server is listening on port 3000 because 5000 is occupied, Exercise 2 specifies to use port 5000.

While `body-parser` is related to building APIs with Express (as it's commonly used for parsing request bodies), it doesn't directly implement any of the specific API functionalities described in the exercises. The exercises involve creating RESTful APIs, CRUD operations, and using Axios, none of which are directly addressed by a `package.json` file.
- To address the exercises, actual server-side code (e.g., JavaScript files using Express) implementing the routes and logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts or books, and fetching data from external APIs using Axios is required.

- This code snippet is a tsconfig.json file, which configures the TypeScript compiler. It does not address any of the exercises described in the chapter content. The exercises involve building RESTful APIs with Express, which requires creating server-side code in JavaScript using Node.js and the Express framework. This tsconfig.json file is only tangentially related to the exercises (as it could be used in a TypeScript project for the API), but does not implement any of the required functionality.
- The provided code should implement the API endpoints as described in the exercises to achieve a higher correctness score.
- Focus on creating the server.js or app.js files with the necessary Express routes and data handling logic.

- The provided code appears to be a module for managing side channels, possibly for storing data associated with objects without modifying the objects themselves. However, it does not directly address any of the exercises described in the chapter content, which involve building RESTful APIs with Express.js. The code is unrelated to the task of creating API endpoints for blog posts or books.

URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day5NodeServer/ExerciseXP/ExerciseXp1/blog-api/node_modules/side-channel/tsconfig.json
suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet is a `tsconfig.json` file, which configures the TypeScript compiler. While `tsconfig.json` files are commonly used in Node.js projects, the provided exercises are focused on building RESTful APIs with Express, not on TypeScript configuration. Therefore, this code is irrelevant to the exercises provided.
- Consider submitting code that directly addresses the instructions in Exercise 1, 2, or 3, such as the `server.js` or `app.js` file containing the Express API implementation.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code appears to be the `type-is` library, which is a utility for checking content types in HTTP requests. This library is not related to building RESTful APIs or CRUD APIs using Express.js as described in the exercises.  The exercises focus on creating server-side applications with specific endpoints for managing data, while this code deals with content type negotiation, a client-server agreement
- The code is well-structured and follows common JavaScript patterns for module creation.  However, its purpose is fundamentally different from the requirements outlined in the chapter.

suggestions for improvement:
- The POST route hardcodes the new blog post's title and content. It should use data from the request body instead.
- The PUT route also hardcodes the updated title and content. It should dynamically update these fields based on the request body.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `blogPost` instead of `blog` in the PUT and DELETE routes).
- Implement error handling middleware for more robust error management.
- Use a more secure way to manage IDs, consider using UUIDs or a database with auto-incrementing IDs.
