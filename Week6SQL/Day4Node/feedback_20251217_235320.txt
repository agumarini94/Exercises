suggestions for improvement:
- The writeFile function in `fileManager.js` is not writing any content to the file, it is missing a data argument.
- `readFile` and `writeFile` in `fileManager.js` do not handle errors appropriately. The errors should be handled and propagated or resolved rather than just logged to the console.  Consider using try/catch blocks and promises for better error management.
- In `fileManager.js`, the `writeFile` function should accept a `data` argument to be written to the file.
- The instructions mention using CommonJS syntax, but the provided code uses ES6 module syntax (import/export). Choose one syntax consistently.
- The `writeFile` function attempts to write with utf-8 encoding, this is incorrect.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code appears to be a utility function (likely from lodash or a similar library) for extracting the values from an object. It's completely unrelated to the chapter's exercises, which focus on Node.js modules, file system operations, and creating applications using CommonJS and ES6 module syntax.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet appears to be a function definition for `valuesIn` that extracts own and inherited enumerable string keyed property values of an object. However, it's not clear which exercise this code is intended to address. It is highly likely this code was pulled from the lodash library. Without context from a specific exercise, it is impossible to assess its correctness in relation to the prompt.
