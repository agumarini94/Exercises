suggestions for improvement:
- The `writeFile` function is not correctly writing content to the file. It is attempting to write 'utf-8' to the file and ignoring the data parameter and should be taking in a second argument for content.
- The `writeFile` and `readFile` functions should handle errors by rejecting a promise or using a callback to signal failure to the caller, not just logging to the console.
- Consider using asynchronous versions of `fs` methods for better performance (e.g., `fs.promises.readFile` and `fs.promises.writeFile`).
- The import statement for 'fs' should use CommonJS syntax (`const fs = require('fs');`) since the exercise specifies CommonJS.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet does not appear to be a solution to any of the provided exercises related to Node.js modules, file system operations, or package usage. It seems to be a utility function (likely from a library like Lodash) that wraps a value with a function. The provided exercises focus on specific tasks such as creating and using modules, file I/O, and using npm packages like `chalk`. Therefore, the code is irrelevant to the exercises.
