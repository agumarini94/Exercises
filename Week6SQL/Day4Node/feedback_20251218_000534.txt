URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day4Node/Exercise3XP/fileManager.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The `writeFile` function is not correctly writing content to the file. It attempts to write `undefined` to the file because the `fs.writeFile` callback receives an error object as the first argument, not the data being written. The content to be written should be passed as the second argument to `fs.writeFile` during the function call.
- The functions use callbacks, which can lead to callback hell in more complex scenarios. Consider using promises or async/await for more manageable asynchronous code.
- Error handling could be improved. The current error handling only logs the error to the console. It would be better to propagate the error to the caller so that the caller can decide how to handle it.
- The module is using ES6 module syntax (`import fs from "fs"`) but the exercise specifically asks for CommonJS syntax. Use `const fs = require('fs')` instead to align with instructions.

URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week6SQL/Day4Node/Exercise5Xp/math-app/node_modules/lodash/fp/_util.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code appears to be a module exporting a collection of functions, possibly related to a utility library like lodash. However, without a specific exercise to relate it to, it is impossible to assess its correctness. The provided code does not address any of the exercises outlined in the chapter content, hence the 0% correctness score.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet appears to be a utility function related to function conversion and currying, possibly within a library like Lodash. However, it's completely unrelated to the chapter content, which focuses on Node.js modules, the `fs` module, and basic file operations.  The exercises involve creating and using modules with CommonJS and ES6 syntax, and performing file system operations like reading and writing files.
- Since the code is not relevant to the exercises described in the chapter content, it cannot be evaluated for correctness within this context.
