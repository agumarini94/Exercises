- The `writeFile` function in `fileManager.js` should accept content parameter to be written in the file.
- The module should export the function using `module.exports = {readFile, writeFile}`
- It would be better to return the result (success/failure) from the functions rather than printing directly to console.

suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet appears to be a utility function for converting other functions, possibly within a larger library like Lodash. However, it doesn't directly address any of the specific tasks outlined in the "Chapter Content/Questions". The tasks involve creating Node.js modules, using NPM packages like 'chalk', and performing file operations using the 'fs' module. The provided code doesn't relate to greeting users, displaying colorful messages, or reading file contents.
- To align with the chapter content, you should create separate files as instructed (greeting.js, app.js, colorful-message.js, etc.) and implement the functionalities described in each task (e.g., exporting a greet function, using the chalk package to display a colorful message, reading file content using the fs module).
