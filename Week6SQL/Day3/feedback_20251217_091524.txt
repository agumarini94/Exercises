suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, question 6.3, the query provided is incomplete and likely contains syntax errors. It attempts to select from 'film.rental.duration' which is incorrect.  It needs to join the `film` table with the `rental` table via the `inventory` table to access rental information. 
- In exercise 2, the response to question 2 is not explicit and complete.  It only mentions that store_id and address_id are foreign keys and gives a vague description of their impact. The explanation should clearly state that these keys constrain the values that can be inserted into the customer table. Specifically, a customer record can only be created if a valid store_id and address_id already exist in the respective tables.
- Comments should be used consistently to explain the purpose of each query, especially in a learning context.
- Remove unnecessary `SELECT *` statements used for debugging after the code is finalized for submission.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, question 6.3, the query to find the third film is incomplete and contains syntax errors (film.rental.duration). It should be corrected to properly join the rental and film tables and filter by rental rate and return date.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code, especially for complex queries, to improve readability.
- The formatting of the SQL code could be improved for consistency. For example, use consistent capitalization for SQL keywords (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.) and consistent indentation to highlight the structure of the queries.
- For exercise 2 question 2, you should have checked the diagram provided to answer. It only had address_id.
- For exercise 2 question 6.2, to find films with rating R, the query should filter the rating column not the title column.
