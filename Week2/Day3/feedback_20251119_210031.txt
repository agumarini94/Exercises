suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 2 is missing. You need to create two files, func.py and exercise_one.py, as described in the instructions.
- In Exercise 3, the instruction says to use uppercase and lowercase letters, but the code uses only lowercase letters. Use `string.ascii_letters` instead of `string.ascii_lowercase`.
- In Exercise 5, the code calculates the user's age in seconds instead of the time until January 1st. The implementation is incorrect according to the goal.
- In Exercise 6, the code calculates the user's age in seconds, which might have been intended for Exercise 5 (calculating remaining time). Rename the function to reflect the calculation.
- In Exercise 7, the `addres` key in the dictionary is misspelled. It should be `address`.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code only addresses Exercise 3 and doesn't include any code for the other exercises.
- For Exercise 3, consider using `''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters, k=5))` for a more concise and efficient way to generate the random string.
- Separate the code into different files or classes to correspond to each exercise for better organization.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code calculates the difference between two dates, which is related to the `datetime` module but does not implement any of the exercises requested, instead of using the `datetime` to create a function that displays the current date. It also does not address any of the other exercises.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code calculates the age in minutes, but it's implemented outside of a class or in relation to previous exercises. It should be integrated as part of a module or in relation to the other exercises in the chapter.
- The input validation could be improved to handle invalid date formats gracefully.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `birthdate_str` instead of `user_age`).
- The comments are in Spanish. Either translate them to English or remove them.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider removing commented-out code to improve readability.
- The variable name `users` inside the loop could be more descriptive to differentiate it from `user_list`.
