suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 2 is missing. You were asked to create a module and import it into `exercise_one.py`. This is not implemented.
- In Exercise 3, the prompt asks to generate a random string of length 5 using the string module, consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters. The current code only uses lowercase letters.
- In Exercise 5 and 6, the prompt wants the time left until January 1st, not the age of the user. The current implementation calculates the user's age based on a provided birthdate.
- Exercise 7 has a logical error. The name of the key in the dictionary is "addres", but it should be "address".

suggestions for improvement:
- The `__str__` method is mostly correct but includes an unnecessary else block and does not manage plural strings correctly.
- The `__int__` method is incorrect. It should return the integer value of the amount, but instead attempts to initialize the class again without proper arguments, leading to an error. The method should be `def __int__(self): return int(self.amount)`
- The `__repr__` method is missing. The instructions explicitly ask for it.
- The `__add__` method lacks proper type checking and currency compatibility checks, and the `__iadd__` method is missing. It needs to check the types and currencies before performing addition, and `__iadd__` should also be implemented to handle in-place addition.
- The class is missing the `__repr__` and `__iadd__` dunder methods that were specified in the requirements.
- The code does not raise a TypeError when trying to add two currencies of different types.
- The code has commented out sections, suggesting the implementation is not complete and the provided test cases are not fully addressed.

suggestions for improvement:
- The problem description asks to create a Currency class, import modules, use the string module, the datetime module and the faker module, the code only implements the string module exercise.
- The code uses a while loop to generate the random string. A for loop or a more concise method like `random.sample` and `join` could be more readable and potentially slightly more efficient.

URL: URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week2/Day3/exercise1Inclass.py
suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a more robust type checking in the `__add__` and `__iadd__` methods to ensure that you are only adding `Currency` objects or integers.
- The conditional logic for singular vs. plural currencies could be slightly more concise, but it is perfectly functional.

URL: URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week2/Day3/exercise5.py
suggestions for improvement:
- The current implementation calculates the difference in days and attempts to convert that to seconds using `.total_seconds()`. This function is designed to be used on `timedelta` objects which already represent time differences, but it is not doing what you expect here.
- The code mixes responsibilities: it gets input, parses the date, and calculates the age all in the global scope. It would be better to encapsulate input and parsing into a separate function.
- The variable names could be improved for clarity.  `fecha_valida` is not very descriptive. Use more descriptive names, and stick to English.
- Handle potential `ValueError` if the user enters an invalid date format.
- The instruction asks for minutes, but you are calculating seconds.
