suggestions for improvement:
- Implement error handling for potential issues like invalid JSON payloads.
- Consider using a more robust data storage solution than an in-memory array, especially for production environments. A database would be more suitable.
- Add input validation to prevent unexpected data from being saved to the books array.
- Use more descriptive variable names and comments.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet only shows the `app.js` part of Exercise 3, and is missing the `routes/books.js` file. Therefore, the complete functionality of the exercise cannot be assessed.
- The routes are mounted on the root path '/' instead of '/books'. This will cause issues with the API endpoints as defined in the exercise instructions. It should be `app.use('/books', router);`
- Port number 3003 is different from the port number mentioned in the instructions (3000).  While this isn't strictly wrong, it's inconsistent with the instructions.
