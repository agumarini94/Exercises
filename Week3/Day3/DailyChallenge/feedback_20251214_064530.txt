suggestions for improvement:
- Instead of using alerts to display the story, update the text content of the 'story' span element as specified in the HTML.
- Consider creating an array of possible stories and randomly selecting one when the 'shuffle' button is clicked. This would fulfill the bonus requirement more effectively.
- Refactor the `newHistory` function to avoid redundant code. The story generation logic is repeated across multiple `if` statements.  You can create a single story template and insert the values.
- Avoid using `alert` for displaying information to the user. It is generally better to update elements within the page.
- The validation logic and subsequent story generation should ideally be separated into distinct functions for better organization and reusability.
- Consider using template literals for easier string concatenation when creating the story.
