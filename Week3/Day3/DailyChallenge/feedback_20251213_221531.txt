suggestions for improvement:
- The HTML code only provides the structure of the Mad Libs game but lacks the core JavaScript functionality to make it interactive.
- You need to add a JavaScript file (DailyChallenge.js) and link it to the HTML to implement the required functionalities such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and story generation.
- Specifically, event listeners for form submission and the shuffle button (bonus) should be implemented in the Javascript file

suggestions for improvement:
- Instead of using alerts to display the stories, update the content of the `span` element with the id `story`. This aligns better with the HTML provided and the intention of the exercise.
- The bonus functionality of shuffling stories is implemented, but the stories generated are repetitive.  Create unique story variations to enhance the user experience.
- Consider using an array to store the different story templates and randomly select one each time the "shuffle" button is clicked.  This will lead to more varied and interesting results.
- The counter variable and the `newHistory` function could be better structured for clarity and reusability.
- Avoid hardcoding the same story structure in each `if` and `else if` block within the `newHistory` function.  This makes the code difficult to maintain and extend.
