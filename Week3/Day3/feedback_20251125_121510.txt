suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using CSS classes for applying styles instead of directly manipulating the style property in JavaScript for better separation of concerns and maintainability.

- Using event delegation on the article for events on paragraphs (e.g., making them bold) could be more performant if you have a large number of paragraphs.
