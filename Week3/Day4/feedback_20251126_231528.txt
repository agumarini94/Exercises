suggestions for improvement:
- Provide actual code solutions for each exercise instead of just embedding the questions from the prompt as comments.
- Add code to address the questions asked in each section, such as using the ternary operator, arrow functions, and self-invoking functions as specified in the exercises.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code only provides the HTML structure and attempts to answer the scope exercise questions as comments. It does not include the code for exercises 2-8, meaning it doesn't address most of the chapter content.
- The comments provided as answers to the scope questions are often incomplete or inaccurate. For example, the answer to #1.2 is incorrect.
- There is a typo in the HTML: '< !DOCTYPE html >' should be '<!DOCTYPE html>'.

suggestions for improvement:
- The code only addresses Exercise 4. You need to create solutions for all exercises: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Please include your predictions and explanations for Exercise 1 in the comments of your javascript file.
- For Exercise 5, address all the instructions. Create three different functions: function declaration, function expression, and an arrow function, all doing the same task.
- For Exercises 6, 7, and 8, make sure to output to the DOM as specified in the instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, you need to provide the predicted outputs and explanations as comments in the Javascript file, and also answer the questions related to `const`.
- For Exercise 2, convert `winBattle()` into an arrow function, and use a ternary operator to assign values to `experiencePoints` based on the function's return value.
- For Exercise 3, create an arrow function that checks if a value is a string and returns `true` or `false`.
- For Exercise 4, create a concise arrow function to sum two numbers.
- For Exercise 5, fully implement all steps: function declaration, function expression, comment explaining the difference, and the arrow function. The code only show the arrow function.
- Exercises 6, 7 and 8 are missing

suggestions for improvement:
- The instructions said to display the sentence in the DOM. You are currently displaying it on the console.
- Consider using template literals for better string formatting.
- For exercise 7: Create a Navbar in your HTML file and create a self-invoking function to add a div in the navbar with the user's name and profile picture.
- For exercise 8: Implement the Juice Bar exercise using nested functions as described in the instructions.

suggestions for improvement:
- For Exercise 1, include the JavaScript code with comments indicating your predictions and explanations, as requested by the prompt.  This is missing from the submission.
- For Exercise 2, 3, 4, and 5, provide the JavaScript code that solves each exercise. These exercises are missing from the submission.
- For Exercise 6, use `document.body.innerHTML += ...` or create elements dynamically and append them to the DOM to fulfill the instruction: 'The function should display in the DOM a sentence...'
- For Exercise 7, although the code adds a welcome message to the navbar, it does not include a profile picture as requested.
- Exercises 1-5 are missing. Add completed solutions for them.
- For Exercise 7, add functionality to include a profile picture in the navbar along with the username.
