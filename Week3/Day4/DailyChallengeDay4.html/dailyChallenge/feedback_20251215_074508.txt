suggestions for improvement:
- The `displayGroceries` function is missing. You need to create an arrow function named displayGroceries that console.logs the 3 fruits from the groceries object using the forEach method.
- In the `cloneGroceries` function, the variable `user` should be assigned the value of `client` *before* `client` is modified. The prompt asks you to observe if the change to `client` affects `user` *after* the assignment, not before.
- The provided code lacks the step of changing the `paid` key to false in `cloneGroceries`. This should be implemented to fully address the prompt.
- The prompt requires the function `cloneGroceries` to be invoked, but the current implementation does not do that.
