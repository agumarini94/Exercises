//Create a function named changeEnough(itemPrice, amountOfChange) that receives two arguments:
// In the function, determine whether or not you can afford the item.
// If the sum of the change is bigger or equal than the item’s price(ie.it means that you can afford the item), the function should return true
// If the sum of the change is smaller than the item’s price(ie.it means that you cannot afford the item) the function should return false

// Change will always be represented in the following order: quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies.
// A quarters is 0.25
// A dimes is 0.10
// A nickel is 0.05
// A penny is 0.01
function changeEnough(itemPrice, amountOfChange){ //4.25 , array
    // for(let money in amountOfChange) //25 , 20 ,5 ,0 
        let quarters = amountOfChange[0] * 0.25;
        let dimes = amountOfChange[1] * 0.10;
        let nickels = amountOfChange[2] * 0.05;
        let pennies = amountOfChange[3] * 0.01;
        let totalMyMoney = quarters + dimes + nickels + pennies; 
        if(totalMyMoney >= itemPrice){
            // alert('you can buy the item');
            return true;
        }
        else;
        console.log('you cant buyy ou have ' + totalMyMoney);
        return false
}

changeEnough(5.25, [25, 20, 5, 0]);


// The value 4.25 represents the item’s price
// The array[25, 20, 5, 0] represents 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies.
// The function should return true, since having 25 quarters, 20 dimes, 5 nickels and 0 pennies gives you 6.25 + 2 + .25 + 0 = 8.50 which is bigger than 4.25(the total amount due)
