suggestions for improvement:
- The code partially fulfills the requirements. It correctly implements Exercise 1, displaying numbers divisible by 23 and calculating their sum. However, it does not include the bonus functionality of accepting a divisor parameter.
- Consider adding the bonus functionality to make the function more versatile.
- It is good practice to avoid direct HTML in the JS file.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain more complex logic.
- Use const instead of let for totalPrice, as it doesn't change outside the function scope.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider removing the unnecessary `else;` after the `if` statement. It doesn't affect the code's functionality but reduces readability slightly.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `numberOfNights` instead of `userNights`).
- The validation for the destination in `planeRideCost` could be more robust.  It currently only checks for empty strings and numbers, but might benefit from checking if the input contains disallowed characters.
- Use `const` instead of `let` for variables that are not reassigned, such as `totalCost` in `hotelCost()` or the return values of the functions called within `totalVacationCost()`.

suggestions for improvement:
- The 'Exercise 5' section of the instructions was partly implemented; some parts are missing or implemented incorrectly.
- The prompt requires not to display the `<li>` that contains the text node “Dan” but is not implemented.
- The border is not correctly set for Richard's `<li>`. It should select the correct `<li>` and apply the border to it.
- The bonus section about the alert is not implemented.

URL: URL: https://github.com/agumarini94/Exercises/blob/main/Week3/Day2/exercise6.html
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code addresses Exercise 6 but is placed inside an HTML file that also includes content from Exercise 5. This makes it difficult to evaluate the code in isolation.
- The prompt requests to modify the element that has an `id` of `navBar`, but the HTML provided does not contain such element. This means the exercise has not been completed correctly.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code only contains the basic HTML structure but lacks the Javascript file with the actual logic to solve the problem. Add the Javascript code to `exercise7.js` to complete the requirements.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding error handling for image loading (e.g., displaying a default image if the URL is invalid).
- The code is well-structured, but adding more comments could further enhance readability, especially for those less familiar with DOM manipulation.
