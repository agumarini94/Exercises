suggestions for improvement:
- The while loop is not necessary, the condition `inputValor.value !== ''` should be an if statement.
- The 'X' button uses both innerHTML and setAttribute which might cause confusion. Stick to one approach. If you are using Font Awesome, you should render the icon in one single line.
- Consider creating functions for creating elements to improve readability and maintainability.
- The code could be improved by adding event listeners to the newly created 'X' buttons to implement the delete functionality
