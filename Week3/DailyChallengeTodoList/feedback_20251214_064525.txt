suggestions for improvement:
- The task addition logic is inside a 'while' loop that's meant to check for empty input, but it immediately breaks, making the loop redundant. It should be an 'if' statement.
- The code appends the new task to the `form` element instead of the `<div class="listTasks"></div>` as specified in the instructions. Target the correct container.
- Missing the functionality to delete the task from the array on click on the 'X' button. Should implement the deleteTask() function as per the instructions.
- The code could be refactored to improve readability, breaking the task creation into smaller, more manageable functions.
