suggestions for improvement:
- The component fulfills the basic theme switching functionality, but it doesn't utilize `useContext` as explicitly requested in the instructions.  This is a major deviation from the problem description.
- The component is self-contained but should be part of a larger application context to fully demonstrate the power of `useContext` as requested in the exercise instructions.  Consider creating ThemeContext and a ThemeProvider to share theme data across components.
- The inline styles work but could be moved to a separate CSS file or styled-components for better organization and maintainability.
