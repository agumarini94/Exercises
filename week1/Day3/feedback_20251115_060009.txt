suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, the `elif` condition should be `family[name] >= 3 and family[name] <= 12` to correctly apply the $10 ticket price based on age.
- In Exercise 3, the logic for adding 'Desigual' to the `international_competitors` list is flawed. The `if` condition is always true because it compares the string 'international_competitors' to itself.  Instead, you should check if the key exists using `if 'international_competitors' in brand:`. Then, to add 'Desigual' to the list, use `.append('Desigual')`.
- In Exercise 3, the logic for printing all keys is unnecessarily complex and doesn't account for nested dictionaries properly. You should use `brand.keys()` directly to get all keys at the top level.
- In Exercise 4, the first two parts of the exercise are printing a separate dictionary in each iteration, instead, you must append all the elements into one single dict and then print. Same thing applies for the 3rd point.
- In exercise 4, you're creating the dictionary inside the loop. This is appending each element one by one. Make sure to create the dictionary first and then add the element.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code addresses all the exercises, but has some critical logical errors: in Exercise 2, the `elif` condition and the adding of `price` is incorrect, so the right price is not given, in exercise 3 the `if` condition for adding desigual is wrong, making it add the value in the wrong way. In exercise 4, the dictionaries are printed on each iteration and not at the end.
- readability: The code is generally readable, with comments explaining the steps. However, some variable names could be more descriptive.
- performance: The code has no major performance issues. The solutions are reasonably efficient for the given tasks.
- security: The code doesn't involve any user input or external data, so there are no security concerns.
