suggestions for improvement:
- Add comments before each exercise to improve the readability and separate sections.
- Exercise 8: The second input within the loop is wrong, the user is repeating the topping instead of writing a new one. `toppings = input(toppings)` should be `toppings = input('Write your toppings, and when dont want more write Quit')`
- Exercise 9: The while loop can be a for loop, because you know the range of inputs.
- Use more descriptive names for variables
- Avoid unnecessary comments (e.g., 'Aca vuelvo a pedir al usuario que ingrese otro topping')
- Remove unused variables.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly addresses all the exercises described in the chapter content. Exercise 8's input error doesn't invalidate the overall high correctness because the logic is right, just the implementation of user interaction is off, and the same with the while and the for in exercise 9.
- readability: The code is mostly readable but can be improved with more comments and better variable names, also removing unnecessary comments.
- performance: The code has good performance in most cases. However, it can be improved by using for loops instead of while loops in certain scenarios, like asking the user for ages in the family.
- security: The code does not have any known security vulnerabilities.
