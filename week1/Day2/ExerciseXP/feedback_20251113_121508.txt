suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain the logic within the loops and conditional statements for better readability.
- The variable names could be slightly more descriptive (e.g., `result_string` instead of `my_string`).
- No security issues detected.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements both Challenge 1 and Challenge 2 as described in the chapter content. Challenge 1 generates multiples of a number based on user input, and Challenge 2 removes consecutive duplicate letters from a user-provided string. All examples provided in the prompt work as expected.
- readability: The code is generally readable, using meaningful variable names and clear logic. However, adding comments and using more descriptive variable names would enhance readability further.
- performance: The code exhibits good performance, using efficient loops and conditional statements. The time complexity is linear, which is appropriate for the given tasks.
- security: The code appears to be secure, with no obvious vulnerabilities. It correctly handles user input without exposing the system to potential security risks.
